Types of Plagiarism 
Some forms of plagiarism are obvious. Copying someone else's essay word for word and submitting it as your own? Plagiarism, of course. Turning in an essay you bought from a paper mill is too. The issue is not always so blatant, however. In addition to overt acts of academic dishonesty, other, more complex forms of plagiarism exist, and they lead to similar consequences nonetheless.
Direct plagiarism is the act of copying another person's work word for word. Inserting a paragraph from a book or article into your essay with including attribution or quotation marks, for example, is direct plagiarism. Paying someone to write an essay for you and submitting it as your own work is also direct plagiarism. If you commit direct plagiarism, you're likely to be caught thanks to software and tools such as Turnitin.
Paraphrased plagiarism involves making a few (often cosmetic) changes to someone else’s work, then passing it off as your. Unless a specific idea is common knowledge, you can include it in your paper without providing a citation—even if you do not include any direct quotes. 
Not everyone who plagiarizes starts out with the goal of stealing someone else's work. Sometimes, plagiarism is simply the result of poor planning and a few bad, panicked decisions.  
Accidental plagiarism occurs when citations are missing, sources are cited incorrectly, or an author shares an idea without a citation that is as common of knowledge as they thought. Accidental plagiarism is often the result of a disorganized research process and a last-minute time crunch. Ultimately, if you fail to cite your sources appropriately, you've committed plagiarism—even if you had every intention of giving credit.
